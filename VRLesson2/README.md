# VRLesson2
VRLesson2 focuses on including assets (models, textures), lights and double-sided rendering
index.html presents an animated figure dancing inside a cube on a brick plane. An ambiental and a point light are included in the scene. Note that the camera is inside the cube and one can see its inside due to the side="double" attribute.
