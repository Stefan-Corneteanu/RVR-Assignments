# VRLesson 5
VRLesson 5 focuses on asset creation using Blender. The assets were developed as follows:

1) Pine: As primitives, a cyllinder and 2 cones were used. The cyllinder was scaled down on the vertical axis and the first cone was scaled up on the horizontal plane, the second cone was left unchanged. Then, the shapes were translated such that they are placed on top of one another.

2) House: 3 cubes were used as primitives: the base, the roof and the chimney. The roof was turned into a pyramid by merging at center the 4 vertices of the top face of the cube. The chimney was scaled on all axis till the shape was deemed correct. The base was cut, adding new vertices, defining the shapes for the door and window.

In order to color the assets, alter the base color of the material for each primitive and change the viewport shading to rendered in the top right of the viewport.

The Assets/Models contains both the original Blender4.4 projects and the models exported under .glb format. These .glb files are used inside index.html
